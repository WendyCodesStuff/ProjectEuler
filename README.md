## PROJECT EULER

Project Euler is a series of mathematical problems which are generally not solvable by brainpower alone, but more are intended to be tackled with algorithms.  These are great practice for mathematically-minded coders and vary in difficulty from the sum of all multiples of 3 and 5 below 1000 to ... well puzzles infinitely more complicated!  

Let's see how far I get!
